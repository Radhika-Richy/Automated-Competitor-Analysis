Project: Automated Competitor Intelligence – Competitor Analysis

Clients: AT&T, Airbnb, Gap, Ford, Wendy’s, Mars

🔍 Project Overview
Problem Statement:
Competitor analysis is traditionally a manual and time-consuming process that involves collecting, processing, and analyzing large volumes of text, image, and video data. This project aims to automate competitor intelligence using Generative AI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and AWS services, significantly reducing manual effort while ensuring accurate, real-time competitive insights.

Solution:
Developed an Automated Competitor Intelligence Framework integrating:

✅ LangChain + RAG for context-aware competitive insights

✅ ChromaDB for efficient document retrieval

✅ AWS services (EC2, Redshift, Textract, S3) for scalable deployment

✅ OCR & Video Frame Extraction for data enrichment

✅ Validation Pipelines to ensure accuracy & relevance

Business Impact:
🚀 Reduced manual competitor analysis time by 70%
📈 Improved accuracy of insights using post-processing validation
💡 Enabled executives to make data-driven strategic decisions


1️Data Sources:

Textual Data (Competitor reports, reviews, financial statements)
Image Data (Competitor ads, website screenshots)
Video Data (YouTube ads, social media videos)

Workflow:
✅ Step 1: Convert unstructured text into embeddings using OpenAI’s text-embedding model.
✅ Step 2: Store & retrieve documents using ChromaDB.
✅ Step 3: Generate context-aware competitive insights via GPT-4 & LangChain.
✅ Step 4: Validate insights with human-in-the-loop and rule-based checks.
