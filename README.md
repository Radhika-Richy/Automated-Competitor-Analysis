Clients: AT&T, Airbnb, Gap, Ford, Wendy’s, Mars

🔍 Project Overview
Problem Statement:
Competitor analysis is traditionally a manual and time-consuming process that involves collecting, processing, and analyzing large volumes of text, image, and video data. This project aims to automate competitor intelligence using Generative AI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and AWS services, significantly reducing manual effort while ensuring accurate, real-time competitive insights.

Solution:
Developed an Automated Competitor Intelligence Framework integrating:

LangChain + RAG for context-aware competitive insights

ChromaDB for efficient document retrieval

AWS services (EC2, Redshift, Textract, S3) for scalable deployment

OCR & Video Frame Extraction for data enrichment

Validation Pipelines to ensure accuracy & relevance

Business Impact:
Reduced manual competitor analysis time by 70%

Improved accuracy of insights using post-processing validation

Enabled executives to make data-driven strategic decisions
